# Quiz Page

This is just a practice project after i finished React. So basically we get 10 question from Open Trivia Database with different options to select from. After answering all the questions we get the score. With basic styling and JSX i tried to develop a small project and this is the result. 

## Future implementation plans
* Add a page to select category, type and number of questions.
* Add a section to enter name and store score in local storage.
*any additional suggestions are welcome :)
